PVEntityGenerator
-----------------

Generates SQL scripts, Java/.NET Entity files and transfers sample data from and to Access databases.

## Overview

PVEntityGenerator is a tool for database applications written in Java and .NET. It's primary target to be used together with the "PVFramework", a proprietary RDBMS mapping framework for legacy Java and .NET applications. But it can also be used standalone as handy tool to transfer table structures and data between an MS Access database and RDMBS servers.

The main functionality:

* Create or update database structures (via auto-generated SQL scripts) in the RDMBS server as defined in the Access database
* Transfer data from the Access database to the RDMBS server and vice versa
* Generate Java/.NET "Entity" class files to be used with the "PVFramework" library

## Database support

The tool was tested with (but supports newer versions as well):

| Platform   | Versions
|------------|--------------------------------
| SQLServer  | Microsoft SQL Server 2000-2005
| Oracle     | Oracle 8i-10g
| MySQL      | MySQL 4.x-5.x
| PostgreSQL | (experimental)

Supported Access database formats:
* Access 2000 (.mdb)
* Access 2007 and up (.accdb)

## Code Generation support

| Platform   | Versions
|------------|--------------------------------
| Java2      | Java2 (JDK 1.4) with PVFramework für Java 3.x
| Java5      | Java5 (JDK 1.5) with PVFramework für Java 4.x
| Java5JPA   | Java5 (JDK 1.5) with Java Persistence (JPA) and Hibernate
| NET        | Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 mit PVFramework.NET 2.x
| NET20      | Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 mit PVFramework.NET 3.x

## Database Model Definition

The database as models in the Access database is the base for the DDL statements generated by the PVEntity Generator including:
* Tables
* Columns
* Data Types
* Default Values
* Primary Keys
* Foreign Keys
* Indexes

However, some features available in RDMBS servers are not available in Access. It's possible to set special "attributes" in the description of each column in the Access database to further customize the data model generated for the RDBMS. These attributes follow the syntax `#attribute` without a value and `#attribute=value` for attributes with value. It's possible to add multiple attributes additional to a description comment for a single field. Example:

```
Field Desciption #size=300 #notest
```

Supported attributes for all platforms:

| Attribute      | Description | Example
|----------------|-------------|----------
| size           | Defines to size of a VARCHAR or CLOB column (independently of the size defined in the Access database which is limited to 255). If this attribute is set on a CLOB columns is generated as VARCHAR on the RDMBS server. | `#size=300`
| identity       | Enables "Auto-Increment"/"Identity" for the column, that means the RDBMS fills it with a new incremented value for each new row. May be not supported for all RDBMS servers. | `#identity`
| auto-increment | Same as 'identity' | `#auto-increment`
| notest         | If set not unit tests are generated automatically for the entity classes | `#notest`
| deprecated     | The column is marked as deprecated in the generated entity class. | `#deprecated`

Additional attributes currently only supported for the 'Java5JPA' platform:

| Attribute            | Description | Example
|----------------------|-------------|----------
| xmlmapping           | Defines a class name for mapping XML content in a CLOB column. The class has to be a POJO with serializable fields. | `#xmlmapping=xxx.yyy.MappingClass`
| searchindex          | Defines that this column is index by full text search. Optionally the index type can be specified as value:<br>`analyzed` (previously: `tokenized`, default)<br>`not_analyzed` (previously: `un_tokenized`)<br>`not_analyzed_no_norms` (previously: `no_norms`)<br>`analyzed_no_norms`<br>`no` | `#searchindex=analyzed`
| searchstore          | Defines if the column value itself should be stored in the index document: `no` (default), `yes`, `compress` | `#searchstore=yes`
| searchembeddepth     | Defines for foreign key columns if depending objects should be indexed as well ("IndexEmbedded"). The value defines the depth. | `#searchembeddepth=1`
| searchboost          | Defines a search boost factor (float number) | `#searchboost=2.5`
| searchdateresolution | Defines the resolution for timestamp fields: `year`, `month`, `day` (default), `hour`, `minute`, `second`, `millisecond` | `#searchdateresolution=day`
| searchfieldbridge    | Defines the class name of a custom  "FieldBridge" or "StringBridge" implementation. | `#searchfieldbridge=xx.yy.FieldBridgeImpl`
